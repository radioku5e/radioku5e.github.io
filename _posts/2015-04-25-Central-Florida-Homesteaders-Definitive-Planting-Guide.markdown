#  The Central Florida Homesteaders Definative Planting Guide (Thanks must go out to UF)

Ok, friends, I got home from a great farmer's market today at Diamond P. A lot of you were there and some of you made great presentations. My wife and I were particularly interested in Ibie Smith's and Terry Lambert's presentations about Bee Keeping, and Living the Homesteading Lifestyle (presented by each respectively).

Michelle and I are going to take the BeeKeeping classes at the extension center this week, and hopefully, with the help of Ibie Smith, we will start a hive later this year.

We also want to go deaper into the HS lifestyle now. Thanks to Terry and his "war call" of do it now, we are going to cut the few strings that held us attached to the grocery store.

With the above in mind, I went to the UF extension website and found they had monthly planting guides for Florida farmers. They had them for each section of Florida, South, Central, and North. However, each was a sepearate PDF file. Additionally each PDF linked to other PDFs. In the guise of simplicity, I downloaded as many of the linked PDFs that were available and I compiled them into one PDF. This work took me 6 or so hours and is 506 pages long. [If you are interested in the guide download it here.](http://www.ku5e.com/downloads/CFlPlanting.pdf)

I am still working on linking the pages to the text on the calendar pages. If you want to use it as is, open the bookmarks pane and use the bookmarks I created to go to the specific areas of interest.

## Upcoming plans for my home microfarm

1. We are going to cross fence the yard.
2. We are going to acquire 2 more sheep, for a totla of 5 (2 males ad 3 females)
3. We are going to set up the chicken pens and house between 25 and 40
4. We are going to create raised planters (total of 160 feet by 3 feet)
5. We are going to continue the Rabbit farming
6. We are going to acquire 2 Goats for milk
