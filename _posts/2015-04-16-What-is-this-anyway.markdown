##  The Hard Diet

When I started 2015, my wife was nagging me. Not much different than lots of your lives if you are married. However, this time **she was right**. 

I am glad I listend to her. The information I gleened from the visit might have saved my life in the long run. My blood pressure was 203/125 and my HgA1C was 6.6. 

The Blood sugar was not that bad, but borderline for diabetes (6.5 is the cutoff). But worse than all these, and probably the cause of them was my weight; I weighed in at a the highest I have ever weighed, 352 pounds. 

Needless to say the doc told me I had to get on meds, and get on a diet. He perscribed Lisinopril for blood pressure, Hydroclorothiazide for water I was accumulating in my legs, and Metformin as a precaustion to keep my blood sugar down. Luckily, I only had to pay for the HCTZ, Publix is so gracius to provide the other two for free. 

I had to make some lifestyle changes, quick. So with this in mind I spooled up my LoseIt app and started to diet. At first it went well, I lost almost 20 pounds by mid March. Then, we had to have our horse's teeth floated (for my non-horse friends, this involves dremeling or sanding down your horses teeth so they can eat comfortably - a necessary evil). So we called our equine dentist, probably the best in the business, Barry Rosenthal. When he showed up at the pasture he was a new man, he must have lost 100 pounds or more. 

I asked him what he had done. He told me he was on a diet called Omnitrition, and that he and his wife were representatives. Being a veteran of the MLM world (Amway Emerald) I was leary, but I met with them. My wife and I spent around $250 in supplements for the diet for half of phase 2. I was of the opinion that that amount of money was worth it if I could lose as much as Barry did. So my wife and I embarked on the 500 calorie voyage. 

Ok, some of you are going to say, "500 calories! that is starvation". It sorta is, but no worse than the the 400 calories most Gastric Bypass Patients suffer through at the begining of their voyage. However, my voyage avoids the surgery, recovery, and $10,000+. In any case this is the story of my voyage. (and how you can do it for much less $$$)

## My progress

    January to March 18

        352 to 332 pounds

    March 18 to April 16

        332 to 302 pounds

    Total lost up to date 50 pounds with 14 days to go in Phase 2

    **More below**

### Day 1 - 2

Take 10 drops (.5 ml) of the drops under your tongue 3 times per day.

Drink between 1/2 gallon to 1 Gallon of water daily.

Weigh yourself daily. 

Eat and eat and eat. You want to eat everything you think you will miss in the next 40 days.


### Day 3 - 40

Take 10 drops (.5 ml) of the drops under your tongue 3 times per day.

Drink between 1/2 gallon to 1 Gallon of water daily.

If you gain a pound, the next day you fast and eat 6 apples (only apples and water) spread out during the day.

No exercise or massages


**Breakfast**

    Coffee, (with stevia and one tbs of milk - if desired)

    Smoothie

        8 Frozen Strawberries

        1 dose of Liquid Vitamin

        1 dose of liquid B12

        1 dose of Metamucil

        1 dose of Glucosamine (optional)

        Water to tase

        (Mix it all in a blender to make a smoothie)


**Snack**

    1  Wasa cracker or Melba Toast or Bread Stick

    (Sometimes I spray with PAM and dust with Garlic Salt)


**Lunch**

    4 oz of a Protein

    4 oz of a Vegetable


**Snack**

    1  Wasa cracker or Melba Toast or Bread Stick

    (Sometimes I spray with PAM and dust with Garlic Salt)


**Dinner**

    4 oz of a Protein

    4 oz of a Vegetable


**Snack** 

    1 Medium Apple

**If you run out of energy during the day, you could get a water enhancer that contains B12 to give you a boost.**

This is around 500 calories per day. Yes, it sounds hard, but after 3 days you will not even notice. And, after 20 days I found that my stomach got smaller. In the morning after my smoothie I could not fit any more food. 


## Day 41-42

Stay on the diet, but do not take the drops.


## Day 43-80 Phase 3 (maintenance)

Do not do 500 calorie and drop diet more than 42 days in a row.

Weigh yourself daily. If you gain 2 pounds, the next day you fast and eat 3 juicy prime rib steaks (only steak and water) spread out during the day.

In phase 3 you start to add good fats, dairy, and good carbs. (1500 Calories)

You should start to exercise lightly


**Basically you follow the nutritional pyramid**


**Bread/Grain**

    (In a small amount) a hand full of crackers or a little more melba toast

    then in phase 2 (Continue to avoid starches such as potato, white rice,

    beans etc.)


**Fruit**

    (From original list of phase 2)


**Dairy**

    1 cup per day


**Vegetable**

    (I have found in my experience that there are a few vegetables that the

    original diet does not mention or says are a risk such as sweet peas of

    carrots. In my experience on this diet I have found no difference in result

    or sustaining weight in this phase. Everyone is different experiment at

    your own risk.)


**Meat/ Protein**

    4 oz - 6 oz per meal


**Guilty Pleasure**

    (When it comes to this diet most people like to stick to the strict lines

    of the original protocol. I have found little tricks to help along the way

    such as sugar free candies and ice creams. Incorporating these items in

    your phase 3 is again, only my experiences and use caution because what

    works for some may not work for others.)


**Sample Phase 3 Menu**


**Breakfast**

    1/2 Cup of milk (if desired)

    Coffee, (with stevia and one tbs of milk - if desired)

    Smoothie with vitamins that you are so used too

    2 Large Scrambled Eggs


**Snack**

    1 serving of Fruit Yogurt (probiotic is better)

    1  Wasa cracker or Melba Toast or Bread Stick


**Lunch**

    4 oz of a Protein

    4 oz of a Vegetable

    2 oz of good grain (Wheat bread, Brown Rice…)


**Snack**

    4 oz Vegetable

    1 Medium Apple


**Dinner**

    4 oz of a Protein

    4 oz of a Vegetable

    2 oz of good grain (Wheat bread, Brown Rice…)


**Desert** (if it fits) *Do not eat after 8PM

    1 serving of no sugar added ice cream


**If you run out of energy during the day, you could get a water enhancer that contains B12 to give you a boost.**


_After you are done with Phase 3 you can do another Phase 1+2 if you need to lose more weight or go to Phase 4 which is long term weight maintenance._



## Phase 4

Start to re-introduce sugars and starches back into your diet.

Adjust your caloric intake to the level that is needed to maintain your desired weight. I use a free app called loseit to track my weight and caloric intake. 

Weigh yourself daily and track it. If you see a gain of 2 pounds in one day, then do a steak day.
